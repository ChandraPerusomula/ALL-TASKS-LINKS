    <h1>Full Stack Definition:</h1>
    <p>A<b>full-stack developer </b>is a professional who can handle both the front-end and back-end aspects of web development. This means they are proficient in creating and managing the user interface (UI) as well as the server-side logic and database interactions that power web applications</p>
    <h2>Front-End Development</h2>
    <p>Front-end development involves creating the part of the website that users interact with directly. This includes designing the layout, styling, and interactive elements. Key technologies used in front-end development include:</p>
        <p><li>HTML: Used to structure the content on the web.

        <LI>BOOT STRAP:
            <P>Bootstrap is one of the popular front-end frameworks which has a nice set of predefined CSS codes. The updated version of Bootstrap5 was officially released on 16 June 2020. Bootstrap is a CSS framework that makes mobile-friendly web development and provides responsiveness.</P>
           <P> The framework is available for free and can be utilized in two ways either by downloading the zip files and incorporating Bootstrap libraries/modules into the project or by directly including the Bootstrap URL and using the online version.</P>

It is also referred as ?write less do more? because it takes a lot of common tasks that requires many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and binds them into methods that can be called with a single line of code whenever needed. It is also very useful to simplify a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
